# üëãüèæ Welcome!  
I'm **Shaurita D. Hutchins**, a PhD student in Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics at UAB. My research combines computational biology, rare disease genomics, and bioinformatics tool development. I focus on identifying genetic modifiers and building tools to advance rare disease research, especially in pulmonary arterial hypertension.
